# Car Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning

## 📄 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast the prices of listed cars using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key features — such as the car’s make, model, price, mileage, and engine specifications — we can accurately predict car values and identify the attributes that most strongly influence pricing.

## 💡 Motivation

Accurate price prediction offers significant benefits to various stakeholders in the automotive market:

- **Car dealerships:** Set more competitive and market-aligned prices.
- **Online platforms:** Provide reliable price recommendations to facilitate fair negotiations between buyers and sellers.
- **Buyers and sellers:** Gain insights into fair price ranges, enabling better-informed purchasing and selling decisions.

## 🧰 Data Preparation

To ensure high-quality predictions, the following data preparation steps were performed:

- Handling missing values.
- Feature engineering to create and refine relevant variables.
- Data cleaning and standardization.

## 🧪 Models Used

We implemented and compared multiple machine learning models to select the most effective one for price forecasting:

- **Bagging**
- **Random Forest**
- **Stacked Regression with Bagging and Random Forest**

## 🏆 Objective

Our main objectives include:

- Predicting car prices accurately using advanced ML techniques.
- Identifying which features most significantly impact car value.
- Providing actionable insights that can enhance pricing strategies and market competitiveness.
