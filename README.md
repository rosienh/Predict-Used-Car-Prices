# Car Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to forecast the prices of listed cars using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key features such as the carâ€™s make, model, price, mileage, and engine specifications so that we can accurately predict car values and identify the attributes that most strongly influence pricing.

## Motivation

Accurate price prediction offers significant benefits to various stakeholders in the automotive market:

- **Car dealerships:** Set more competitive and market-aligned prices.
- **Buyers and sellers:** Gain insights into fair price ranges, enabling better-informed purchasing and selling decisions.

## Models Used

We implemented and compared multiple machine learning models to select the most effective one for price forecasting:

- **Bagging**
- **Random Forest**
- **Stacked Regression with Bagging and Random Forest**
